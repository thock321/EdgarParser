# Edgar Parser

An SEC Edgar parser that can parse mutual fund holdings and print them to a tab-separated file.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

'''
BeautifulSoup 4
'''

## Running tests

Simply run 'EdgarParser.py' to test functionality.  It will parse a list of pre-determined CIKs and output them to a tab-separated file.

## Usage

Here is an example to create an instance of an 'EdgarParser' with a specified CIK:

'''
ep = EdgarParser(cik=CIK)
'''

By default, 'EdgarParser' will get the latest mutual fund holdings data occurrence.  For example, if fund XXX last reported holdings was on 5/30/2017, then EdgarParser will get the holdings reported on 5/30/2017 instead of the latest filing date.
If you only want mutual fund holdings from the latest 13F filing, then specify 'get_last_holding' to be FALSE.

'''
ep = EdgarParser(cik=CIK, get_last_holding=False)
'''

If you want to get holdings before a certain date, simply specify it in the form of 'YYYYMMDD'.

'''
ep = EdgarParser(cik=CIK, date_before='20170530')
'''

Now to get the URL for the XML with all of the holdings data, we can simply call 'get_latest_file'.

'''
ep.get_latest_file()
'''

To print the holdings data to a tab-separated file, simply call 'fund_holdings_to_tsv'.

'''
ep.fund_holdings_to_tsv()
'''
